Week 1: Problem Solving
Day 1: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Problem: LeetCode Link
Solution: This problem is solved using the sliding window technique. We maintain a window of characters, expanding it as long as characters are unique. If a duplicate is found, the window is adjusted by removing characters from the left.
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(min(n, m)), where n is the length of the string and m is the size of the character set.
